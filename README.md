## Understanding Business Goals and Expectations

Before diving into technical details, it may be important to start by defining the Business Objective and Key Results (OKRs). Establishing these can guide decisions about technical requirements during the design process. Below is an example of Business OKRs:

### Objective 1: Enhance Understanding of Consumer Behaviour
- **Key Result 1:** Conduct user journey mapping for 80% of app users by the end of Q3.
- **Key Result 2:** Identify and document the top 5 pain points in the booking process within 60 days.

### Objective 2: Improve Conversion Rate through Data-Driven Insights
- **Key Result 1:** Analyse booking funnel data to identify a 10% drop-off at each stage within the next quarter.
- **Key Result 2:** A/B test 3 different user flow optimizations and select the most effective one based on a 5% improvement in booking completion rates.

### Objective 3: Optimize User Experience Across Platforms
- **Key Result 1:** Reduce the average booking time by 20% on both mobile and web platforms by the end of Q4.
- **Key Result 2:** Increase the number of repeat bookings by 25% through targeted user journey improvements within the next 2 quarters.

By this, we can reasonably conclude that the Product Manager and Business Analyst will have bi-weekly meetings to review progress on the consumer journey analysis and assess the effectiveness of implemented strategies.
